Client-Specific Theming App
This React application demonstrates how to dynamically switch the theme based on the logged-in client using Tailwind CSS and local storage. Each client has its own unique primary and secondary color, which are applied globally to the app's styling.

Features
Client-Specific Theming: Automatically applies a color theme based on the client selected in the dropdown.
Dynamic Color Switching: The app updates the color scheme on the fly when the client is switched, using Tailwind CSS variables.
User-Friendly Dropdown: The dropdown list allows users to select a client, with each option styled in the client's primary color.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-theming-app.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd client-theming-app
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Install Tailwind CSS:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
Configure Tailwind CSS by adding the following to the tailwind.config.js file:

js
Copy code
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: 'var(--color-primary)',
        secondary: 'var(--color-secondary)',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
Usage
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

You will see a dropdown menu where you can select a client. Each client has its own primary and secondary colors, and switching between them will dynamically change the theme.
